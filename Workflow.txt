Workflow: 

1. User not yet entered his login/password: 
1.1. Present the only screen with "Login" button
1.2. Upon clicking "login" we ask login/password. 
1.2.1. No check of login/pass is done at the momemnt. Need to add later?? 
1.3. When login is first added, we show Main Screen (2) with additional text saying "success".
2. Main screen: 
2.1. "Change settings" - leads to login/password (1.2)
2.2. "DO IT" - Makes a FULL PAGE screenshot 
2.2.1. "Step 1": screen with options: 
       - zoom in/out (as full page is printed)
       - crop image
       - draw on it
2.2.2. "Step 2": pop up with options: 
       - Subject
       - Description
       - "Send" button
2.2.3. "Step 3": after sending, user gets a link to the post 
2.2.3.1. In case of error, we give description of error we got


TBD:

+ progress bar on save
- "ESC" to cancel selecting
- server: submit to tickets, not posts
- error handling on sending
